McInally Hotel apparently has a great exhibit on the life and times of Kraken Fodder's creator.  

# I'd like to see it!
Well, one small problem - only hotel guests can view the exhibit.

# Can I just walk in anyway?
No, the receptionist will ask your name.

# I'm cleo!
Is cleo a registered guest at the hotel?

# ...no.
How will you find out the guests' names?

# By asking them?
By all means, try - one of them is bound to be [useful.](hotelguest.md)

# Hmm...
So, nobody introduces themselves with their first and last names - what does the receptionist say when you try to see the exhibit?

# She asks my name.
And you're making them up, so that doesn't work - how does she know the guest's names?

## Telepathy?
No, the guest book right next to her! Read it to find some believable-sounding names.

Fun fact: The names listed in this book are people who backed the game on kickstarter!

# Believable names, hooray!
Oh, now she wants to know their room numbers. Did you remember them?

# There were hundreds of names!
And if you think about it, that's thousands of potential voice lines recorded.

# Which is a lot for a small budget...
So you only need to look out for four names in the book!

Also note the symbols on the pages.

## This book hurts my brain. Explicit help, please?

# Let me see that exhibit!
Not so fast - the receptionist now wants to know your check digit.

You do know what a check digit is, don't you?

# Um... 
I thought not. You may need this next hint.

## Tell me where to find a guest's check digit.
There's a bit of an adventure to go on first! Have a look at [this guide](HighSeas/index.md) for assistance with travelling the high seas.

## I have seen unspeakable sights, and have a room card.
Return to the hotel and check the guest book - your room card only has half of the solution.

## What am I looking for?
Your card should say something like "Room Card for Room '49 of Hearts'".

So if you look in the guest book for the name staying in Room 49 of Hearts, you'll find the name you need to tell the receptionist.

The check digit is ^[also in the card's item description.]

# I'm in!
At long last - now have a good look around!

# Woah, a chart detailing all the fish and how to catch them?!
Wow! If only you had something to trace it with...

## Like what?
Like the coloured pencils you got from the restaurant, and the paper you pulled from Atilantis' mummy!

# Hooray, stealing!
Now you have a diagram of all the fish and how to catch them, accessed by pressing TAB.

See [this guide](fishing.md) for a text version of the diagram.
