McInally Hotel apparently has a great exhibit on the life and times of Kraken Fodder's creator.  

# I'd like to see it!
Well, one small problem - only hotel guests can visit the exhibit.

# Can I just walk in anyway?
No, the receptionist will ask your name.

# I'm cleo!
Is cleo a registered guest at the hotel

# ...no.
How will you find out the guests' names?

# By asking them?
By all means, try - one of them is bound to be [useful.](hotelguest.md)

# Hmm...
So, nobody introduces themselves with their first and last names - what does the receptionist say when you try to see the exhibit?

# She asks my name.
And you're making them up, so that doesn't work - how does she know the guest's names?

## Telepathy?
No, the guest book right next to her! Read it to find some believable-sounding names.

Fun fact: The names listed in this book are people who backed the game on kickstarter!

# Believable names, hooray!
Oh, now she wants to know their room numbers. Did you remember them?

# There were hundreds of names!
And if you think about it, that's thousands of potential voice lines recorded.

# Which is a lot for a small budget...
So you only need to look out for four names in the book!

Also note the symbols on the pages.

## This book hurts my brain. Explicit help, please?
