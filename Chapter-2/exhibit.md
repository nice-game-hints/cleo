McInally Hotel apparently has a great exhibit on the life and times of Kraken Fodder's creator.  

# I'd like to see it!
Well, one small problem - only hotel guests can view the exhibit.

# Can I just walk in anyway?
No, the receptionist will ask your name.

# I'm cleo!
Is cleo a registered guest at the hotel?

# ...no.
How will you find out the guests' names?

# By asking them?
By all means, try - one of them is bound to be [useful.](hotelguest.md)

# Hmm...
So, nobody introduces themselves with their first and last names - what does the receptionist say when you try to see the exhibit?

# She asks my name.
And you're making them up, so that doesn't work - how does she know the guest's names?

## Telepathy?
No, the guest book right next to her! Read it to find some believable-sounding names.

Fun fact: The names listed in this book are people who backed the game on kickstarter!

# Believable names, hooray!
Oh, now she wants to know their room numbers. Did you remember them?

# There were hundreds of names!
And if you think about it, that's thousands of potential voice lines recorded.

# Which is a lot for a small budget...
So you only need to look out for four names in the book!

Also note the symbols on the pages.

## This book hurts my brain. Explicit help, please?

# Let me see that exhibit!
Not so fast - the receptionist now wants to know your check number.

You do know what a check number is, don't you?

# Um... 
I thought not. You may need this next hint.

## Tell me where to find the guest's check number.
On another island! Have a look at [this guide](HighSeas/index.md) for assistance with travelling the high seas.

# I have a check number now.
Return to the hotel and tell the receptionist your number when prompted.

## What's my check number?
