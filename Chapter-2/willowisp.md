McInally Palms is a bit nicer than the previous island - it even comes with a warm welcome from the booth worker Ingo.

# Where should I begin exploring?
After talking to Ingo, that's up to you!

For a general indicator of progress, you can find two useful items without going inside any buildings.

# What might the first item be?
Something greasy.

# Like what?
Like something you'd rub on your hands.

## Where can I find something greasy?
Directly left of Ingo, you get the greasy sunscreen by agreeing to rub it onto the Pale Girl's back.

# How will the sunscreen help me?
Have you found something that's too hard for Cleo to move?

# Where can I find something like that?
On the right side of the island.

## Tell me where to use the sunscreen.
Atop the lighthouse, a tight screw is difficult for Cleo to loosen; use the sunscreen on it.

# What was the second useful item you mentioned?
A fruit.

# What colour is this fruit?
Yellow.

## What is the fruit, where can I find it?
You can find the lemon north-west of Ingo, in a graveyard - cross two bridges and a small lemon tree is atop a grave.

# How will the lemon help me?
Do you remember reading about lemons anywhere?

## I can't remember reading about lemons anywhere.
Check your Cocktail Bible - it's still in your inventory, and one of the cocktails requires a lemon.

## What else does that cocktail require?

Base: Salt Lick Smitty - Tequila
Modifier: Sherbe Powder
Flavor: Lemon

# Who might want this 'Risky on the docks' cocktail?
Have you thoroughly talked to everyone on the island?

# There's only a pale woman and Ingo. I don't want to talk to Ingo.
Try entering a few buildings.

# None of these people seem thirsty.
Enter the McInally Hotel, and talk to everyone in the lobby.

Remember that the 'Risky on the docks' cocktail has a clue in its name.

## I'd like to know who needs to drink this cocktail.
