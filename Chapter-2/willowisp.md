You've searched high and low, catching crazy-looking fish and exploring almost every square inch of the ocean - what now?

## I have the rarest fish.
Great - do you remember who was asking for it?

# Nope!
You had to find him yourself - he wasn't on the map originally.

## Where do I put the fish?
In the capable hands of the restaurant owner - grid space C1.

# What do I do with this reward?
Who might be interested in this one-of-six-kind item?

## I don't know, who?
The owner of Atilantis, of course! Head to grid space C4 and see what he thinks of it.

# He's impressed!
Now grab the will-o-wisp and head back to the boat!
