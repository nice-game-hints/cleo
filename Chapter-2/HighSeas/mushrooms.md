You've done some sailing, and arrived on island A4. What do you see?

# Weird plants!
Try getting a closer look.

# About that...
Yeah, they've gone underground. What does Cleo have to say about this?

# Rude things.
Naturally - is there an objective third party on the island somewhere?

# It's a small island...
Exactly, so it won't take you long to find a hint!

# Speaking of hints.
Read the sign on the rock.

It says, in very small letters: ^[Please don't get too close! These glowing mushrooms are very shy, and withdraw as soon as they feel pressured. Each of these rare mushrooms is connected underground to an alternate location.']

# What now?
Do you have anything that could block or fill those holes?

## Can you tell me what I'm looking for?
Corks! You might find some closer to civilisation.

## Where are the corks?
In the hotel, promintently displayed on the far left.

# Is there anything else to do on the island?
Fishing! [This guide](Chapter-2/fishing.md) can tell you more.

# I have put a cork in the hole. Now what?
It means that the mushroom can't get back - where else might you find mushrooms?

## I don't know.
Island I4! Set sail!

# More mushrooms?!
Yes, they're connected underground of course! Notice anything different?

# One of them isn't escaping!
That's right, because you plugged up the hole on the other island.

# What do I do with this mushroom?
You talked to someone who was interested in mushrooms earlier.

# Er...
They were close to the corks you shamelessly stole.

## Who?
The hotel guest that was writing in her travel diary! Set sail for the hotel!
