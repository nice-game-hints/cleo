You've done some sailing, and arrived on island A4. What do you see?

# Weird plants!
Try getting a closer look.

# About that...
Yeah, they've gone underground. What does Cleo have to say about this?

# Rude things.
Naturally - is there an objective third party on the island somewhere?

# It's a small island...
Exactly, so it won't take you long to find a hint!

# Speaking of hints.
Read the sign on the rock.

It says, in very small letters: ^[Please don't get too close! These glowing mushrooms are very shy, and withdraw as soon as they feel pressured. Each of these rare mushrooms is connected underground to an alternate location.']

# Where should I start?
You've got a whole ocean to explore - why not look around as you please?

## Can I get some island-specific guides?
