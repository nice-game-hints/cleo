Like I said, time to set sail!

# Setting sail? How?
You know someone with a boat.

# Where should I start?
If you're still looking for the boat, try heading back to Ingo and looking around.

When you find it, you've got a whole ocean to explore - why not look around as you please?

## Can I get some island-specific guides?
These guides should be followed in order.
