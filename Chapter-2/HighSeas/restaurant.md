You've visited the glorious Atilantis, and heard about a restaurant. Where might that be?

# Where should I begin looking?
Wasn't there a book advertising the restaurant inside Atilantis?

# It didn't tell me where, though.
It said it was a "good bit north from here" - "here" being Atilantis.

## Can you tell me where to find the restaurant?
Grid space C1.

# What am I doing here?
You should talk to the old man for a hint on what to do next.

# Is there anything else to see here?
Yes! You should look around.

## What should I be taking away from the island?
A lobster claw from the bucket left of the old man, and 'Sushi Madness Colored Pencils' from the nearby children's table.

# What do I do with the lobster claw?
Its description in your inventory may prove useful.

## Please tell me exactly what to do with it.
Its description said it could be used as pliers - so you'll use them as pliers by returning to the lighthouse on McInally Palms.

# What has that done for me?
Cleo mentioned the mirror reflecting the sun's rays somewhere - do you remember where?

## No, the sun was in my eyes. Help?
The beach, where you met the pale woman!

# What did she drop?
A room card - pick it up and have a look at it in your inventory.

# Is this what I think it is...?
Damn right - time to see the [exhibit!](/Chapter-2/exhibit.md)
