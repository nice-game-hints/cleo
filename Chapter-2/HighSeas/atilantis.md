You've done some sailing, and arrived on the grid space C4. What do you see?

# A weird green thing!
Get a closer look - it seems to have a note on it.

# That's not all.
Seems you'll need a ticket - do you have one?

# Nope!
Have you visited [Island A4](mushrooms.md) yet?

# Yes!
And did you get what you wanted from that island?

# Yes! Again!
So you've played and won a risky game of Kraken Fodder?

## YES!
Then head back to Atilantis with your ticket and get access!

# What is going on down here?
Wow, look at all of those rare items!

# They're... interesting looking.
No, I mean LOOK at them! Left click!

You'll get the ^[Thin Paper] and ^[Golden Thread].

# Oh, I have some things now. Now what?
Talk to Atila about the will-o-wisp.

# What else is there to do down here?
Maybe some reading?

## Reading? Reading what?
A book next to Atila will tell you about a restaurant opening north of Atilantis. [Maybe you could visit?](restaurant.md)
