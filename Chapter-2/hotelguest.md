You've entered the hotel, and met a woman with things you want - but a high-stakes game of Kraken Fodder is 'too risky' for her.

# What can I do about that?
Do you remember reading about risks anywhere?

# No, where can I read about risks?
The cocktail diary has an entry you might be interested in reading, and [this guide](willowisp.md) can tell you where to find the ingredients.

## I've already made the Risky On The Docks cocktail.
The hotel guest writing in her travel diary needs to live a little - give her the cocktail.

# Is this morally wrong?
Yes.

# She's drank it. What now?
Talk to her, and you'll need to wager an item.

## What kind of item?
Bait and stamps won't cut it - do you remember what she wanted as a souvenir?

# Was it...
From a far-off island, yes. See [this guide](../HighSeas/index.md) for travelling the high seas.
