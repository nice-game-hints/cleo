You've entered the hotel, and met a woman with possessions that would fare better in your hands - but a high-stakes game of Kraken Fodder is 'too risky' for her.

# What can I do about that?
Do you remember reading about risks anywhere?

# No, where can I read about risks?
The cocktail diary has an entry you might be interested in reading.

# What goes into the cocktail?
You can read [this guide](palms.md) to learn about the ingredients and where to find them.

# I've made the Risky On The Docks cocktail.
The hotel guest writing in her travel diary needs to live a little - give her the cocktail.

# Is this morally wrong?
Yes.

# She's drank it. What now?
Talk to her, and you'll need to wager an item.

## What kind of item?
Bait and stamps won't cut it - do you remember what she wanted as a souvenir?

# Was it...
Something far away, yes - see [this guide](HighSeas/index.md) for assistance with travelling the high seas.

## I have something she'd be interested in, now.
Great, you got the glowing mushrooms - wager them and start a game of kraken fodder!

If you'd like a reminder on how to play Kraken Fodder, see [this guide.](/Chapter-1/krakenfodder.md)

It may be worth saving before agreeing to duel, as she's harder to beat than Erik!

SPOILER - ^[You won't actually lose anything when being defeated, and can lose as many times as you need.]

# I AM VICTORIOUS!
Congratulations! To the winner goes a ticket to the one and only [Atilantis.](HighSeas/atilantis.md)
