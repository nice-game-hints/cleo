You've entered the hotel, and met a woman with possessions that would fare better in your hands - but a high-stakes game of Kraken Fodder is 'too risky' for her.

# What can I do about that?
Do you remember reading about risks anywhere?

# No, where can I read about risks?
The cocktail diary has an entry you might be interested in reading.

# What goes into the cocktail?
You can read [this guide](willowisp.md) to learn about the ingredients and where to find them.

# I've made the Risky On The Docks cocktail.
The hotel guest writing in her travel diary needs to live a little - give her the cocktail.

# Is this morally wrong?
Yes.

# She's drank it. What now?
Talk to her, and you'll need to wager an item.

## What kind of item?
Bait and stamps won't cut it - do you remember what she wanted as a souvenir?

# Was it...
Not from this island, no - see [this guide](HighSeas/index.md) for assistance with travelling the high seas.
