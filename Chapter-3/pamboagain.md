You rushed to tell Avery about the treasure! I bet he'll be excited to hear the good news!

# I got the reaction I expected.
Cleo mentioned something about your inventory - did you notice?

## Cleo didn't say anything about my inventory, and nothing has changed.
You need to dig up the worm - use [this guide](caving.md) for help with getting your hands on the slippery guy.

# Ah, my inventory.
Yes, it has a few nibble marks in it. But hungry mouths should be fed!

# Mouth...s? More than one?
The worm loved the taste of the glowing mushroom, and interacting with the hole you dug him out of might be a good idea.

## Tell me what to do next.
Put the 'nibbled glowing mushroom' into the hole you got the worm from.

# Feeding a family is a noble thing to do! I am a lovely person!
Hold that thought - you could say new targets have been acquired.

## Surely you don't mean...
I do. Start digging!

# Whew! They like to wriggle!
Yup - and they're glowing!

# Glowing worms... Do they taste good?
Probably not - to you!

## To who?
To fish! Some have gathered around Avery and are probably hungry.

# Now what?
Glowing fish are pretty cool on their own - you could see them from a mile away!

# And?
That's what Malthe needed to find a way out of the fog!
