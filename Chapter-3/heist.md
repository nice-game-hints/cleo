Finally back on dry(ish) land! But with the curator gone, who will show you these exquisite sights?

# This place is pretty sparse.
That's because it's after closing time - what do you do when you're leaving a place for the night?

# Put my coat on?
And... how do you make sure nothing gets stolen?

## I don't get paid enough for that.
Ah, the wonders of capitalism.

Things got locked away - look at the only thing in the room you can interact with.

# Am I supposed to guess?
No, dummy - there's clues everywhere, if you know where to look!

# Where do I look?
Your inventory would be a good place to start. Is anything relevant to the place you're in?

## What is the code?
1652 - the year Atilantis was founded. You learn this from the Ticket for Atilantis' item description.

# Ah, treasure...
Grab that Kraken Fodder set!
