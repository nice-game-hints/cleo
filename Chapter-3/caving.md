That was... trippy, to say the least. But you only had half of a story to work with - how can you learn the rest?

# Yeah, how can I learn the rest of the story?
Woah, before I answer that, did you see? That lightning almost hit you!

^[... Don't you want to get a closer look? Burn marks are cool!]

## Of course, but how does that help me?
Pick up the burning branch.

# Is this a safety hazard?
Oh yes, definitely. Fire is a source of heat ^[And light!]

## Can I put it out?
No, don't do that - use it to see inside the cave!

# This place is creepy.
Best grab anything you can find and get out!

# Is this what I think it is?
Hell yeah, the shovel from the prologue! Hasn't aged a day!

Did you find a something pesky that the shovel can help you deal with?

## I don't see any tutorial-y mounds of dirt anymore.
Run up the hill and give the worm a good what-for with the shovel!

# Now what?
Cleo thought she recognised the coin - do you?

# Coin... coin. 
Where did you literally just see a coin? What do you still have in your inventory?

## It's a coin. What do you mean?
It's time for another mind journey - you saw the coin in the 'mind space' earlier, so have another drink of Coffee 2 Know in the same spot and [get back in there!](trippy.md)
