Talking to Avery revealed even more of his backstory - that's all well and good, but how will we get off the island?

# Things are looking bleak...
Cleo and Avery aren't the only people stuck on the island - who else can you ask?

# Who?
Your cocktail-loving friend, of course! He might have an idea of how to get off the island.

# I've talked to Malthe. Now what?
Look at the cocktail bible. Could anything in it help you?

## Which cocktail am I supposed to make?
The Coffee 2 Know. Its ingredients are:

Base - Mead
Modifier - Rainwater
Flavor - Coffee

# Where do I get rainwater?
It's raining - maybe you have something that could hold the rainwater?

# Like what?
Something that it could be held in, like a bowl.

## What am I supposed to use to get rainwater?
The coconut shell - water is dripping down the cliff and can be collected by the shell.

# What were the ingredients again?

Base - Tolkins Zither - Mead
Modifier - Coconut Shell with Rain Water
Flavor - Instant Coffee

# I've made the Coffee 2 Know. Now what?
Somebody needs to drink it.

## Who?
You! But you can't just drink it anywhere - Cleo is dramatic.

^[Head to the top of the cliff, right of the tree, to be in the perfect spot for a drink.]

# This is weird...
I know, right? Have a look around.

# What are these pictures?
Coffee 2 know is all about clarity - listen to the sound and connect it to one of the pictures that appears.

You can stand on the picture with a colourful border to hear its voice line again.

Standing on the wrong one will ^[just make it disappear - there are no consequences.]

## Which one do I stand on first?
The coffin.

## And after that?
Avery Allwick, in his delightful parrot form.

# Now what?
Woah, that lightning almost hit you!

... Don't you want to get a closer look? Burn marks are cool!

## Of course, but how does that help me?
Pick up the burning branch and use it to enter the cave.

# This place is creepy.
Best grab anything you can find and get out!

# Is this what I think it is?
Hell yeah, the shovel from the prologue! Hasn't aged a day!

Did you find a something pesky that the shovel can help you deal with?

## I don't see any mounds of dirt.
Run up the hill and give the worm a good what-for with the shovel!

# Now what?
Cleo thought she recognised the coin - do you?

## It's a coin. What do you mean?
It's time for another mind journey - you saw the coin in the 'mind space' earlier, so have another drink of Coffee 2 Know and get back in there!

# I went on the same mind journey - which symbols do I stand on?
Do you recognise the logo on the coin? It looks like ^[The letter A, doesn't it?]

## Which picture do I stand on?
Atila's - the coin had Atilantis' insignia on it.

## THE TREASURE!
Go tell Avery what you've discovered!

# I got the reaction I expected.
Look at your inventory - notice anything different?

# Wow, that's rude.
Feeding a family is a noble thing to do, though!

# Feeding a family?
The worm loved the taste of the glowing mushroom, and looking at the hole you dug him out of is a good start.

## Tell me what to do next.
Put the nibbled glowing mushroom into the hole you got the worm from.

# Aw, now I feel good.
Hold that thought - you could say new targets have been acquired.

## Surely you don't mean...
I do. Start digging!

# Whew! They like to wriggle!
Yup - and they're glowing!

# Glowing worms... Do they taste good?
Probably not - to you!

## To who?
To fish! Some have gathered around Avery and are probably hungry.

# Now what?
Glowing fish are pretty cool on their own - you could see them from a mile away!

# And?
That's what Malthe needed to find a way out of the fog!
