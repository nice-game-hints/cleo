Talking to Avery revealed even more of his backstory - that's all well and good, but how will we get off the island?

# Things are looking bleak...
Cleo and Avery aren't the only people stuck on the island - who else can you ask?

# Who?
Your cocktail-loving friend, of course! He might have an idea of how to get off the island.

# I've talked to Malthe. Now what?
Look at the cocktail bible. Could anything in it help you?

## Which cocktail am I supposed to make?
The Coffee 2 Know. Its ingredients are:

Base - Mead
Modifier - Rainwater
Flavor - Coffee

# Where do I get rainwater?
It's raining - maybe you have something that could hold the rainwater?

# Like what?
Something that it could be held in, like a bowl.

## What am I supposed to use to get rainwater?
The coconut shell - water is dripping down the cliff and can be collected by the shell.

# What were the ingredients again?

Base - Tolkins Zither - Mead
Modifier - Coconut Shell with Rain Water
Flavor - Instant Coffee

# I've made the Coffee 2 Know. Now what?
Somebody needs to drink it.

## Who?
You! But you can't just drink it anywhere - [Cleo is dramatic.](trippy.md)
