So, you can't explore very far - what is there to see?

# A massive sign for a place called 'Teddy's'.
Worth checking out - maybe you can meet Teddy McInally?

## I have some questions for him!
Yes, you do - but you'll need to beat the bouncer at Kraken Fodder first.

If you'd like a reminder on how to play Kraken Fodder, see [this guide.](/Chapter-1/krakenfodder.md)

SPOILER - ^[Don't worry if you lose - you have as many attempts to win as you need.]
DOUBLE SPOILER - ^[You can get in without playing kraken fodder - just double, triple, and quadruple down on your hatred for it when prompted.]

# I AM VICTORIOUS!
Another win in the bag, nice! [Now get inside!](teddy.md)
