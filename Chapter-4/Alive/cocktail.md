You're alive, that's something. But what can you do?

# Where am I?
You're back in the hotel - it must be after closing time, the lights are off and the fire is out.

# Is Malthe okay?
He's certainly worth checking on - but you can probably imagine what he'd say at a time like this?

## He has a catchphrase?
Yeah! "There's no problem a cocktail can't solve!"

# This is pretty dire...
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

# What do you suggest?
Have you looked at every page of the cocktail bible?

## This one seems dangerous.
Yep - Near Death Experience. The name's pretty on the nose.

# What are its ingredients?
Base: Herbal Liqueur
Modifier: Cold Ashes
Flavor: A Personal Sacrifice

# Where do I find cold ashes?
Wasn't a fire burning in the hotel earlier? 

## Where in the hotel do I find cold ashes?
In the fire pit - very close to the stairs, opposite where you stole the corks.

# But wait, wasn't the attempt 38 destroyed? Where's the COCKTHAL-8000?
Have a look outside.

## Oh...
You found Avery again - shame he wasn't put in the body of a weasel.

# Ah, COCKTHAL!
He's looking a bit run-down; where could the ingredients be?

# Herbal Liqeur?
COCKTHAL doesn't have any of the usual bottles with him - so where would you find herbal liqeur at this time of night?

# Has herbal liqeur been relevant to the story?
It received a passing mention not long ago - a favourite of someone you saw briefly in the afterlife.

## Can you tell me where to find Herbal Liqeur?
It's an abstract solution - at the top of the graveyard's hill, a grave can be dug up for herbal liqeur. Boozy Britta's favourite.

# What about the 'personal sacrifice?'
What have you carried with you the entire game?

# These wonderful hints?
Aw, you're too kind! No, something in your inventory.

# Tell me what I'm looking for.
Cleo's diary / journal - you need to damage it somehow.

## Tell me how to sacrifice the journal.
The barrel of ink that Avery was standing atop will let you dunk it inside, making the pages unreadable, by pressing TAB.

If it's not working - ^[be sure to equip the journal by opening your inventory and left-clicking it.]

# Remind me how to make the cocktail?
Base: Hunting Accident - Herbal Liqueur
Modifier: Cold Ashes
Flavor: Blackened Logbook

# I've made the 'Near Death On The Beach'cocktail.
Oh, [go to hell!](deadagain.md)
