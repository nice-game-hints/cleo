So, you tried to get the 20th flower and ended up with a sore foot. What's up with that?

# I have found the source of the foot pain.
Ah, of course - the shrimp empire at the behest of Shrimpus Maximus.

Your new objective is to take out that beaver you may have seen when exploring the island earlier.

# Where do I even begin?
You've got a broken lance now - what does it look like?

# A weapon?
Well, for shrimp, yes - but what can it do for a human?

## Knitting?
No, lock picking! This is a video game! Go pick the locked drawer in the tent!

# Stealth Increased!
You got the socks and [Malthe's cocktail bible.](malthe.md)

If that name is unfamiliar, try exploring the island some more.

# Uh, socks? In a drawer?
Don't question it - instead, question what you could do with them.

# A hint, please?
They're quite a distracting colour.

## A less cryptic hint, please?
Put the socks on the washing line to distract the crab.

^[This gives you the opportunity to grab the tights from the washing line.]

# Now what?
It always helps to know your enemy. Don't you have a good vantage point near here?

# I see the beaver!
Doesn't that forked tree look suspicious?

## How can a tree look suspicious?
Like it can be used as a weapon! Put the tights between the branches, and you've basically made a slingshot.

If you have a projectile, use it here too - if not, [explore the island for one.](malthe.md)

# Target down!
You should share the good news with a friend who was eager to see the beaver fall.

# We are victorious!
And to the victor goes the twentieth flower that the Siren wanted!

# What else is over here?
There's not much to see - but get a close look at everything on this island.

## I'm coming away mostly empty handed...
Aside from the twenty-six extra folo flowers, there's a pile of wood where the beaver once was.

Get a close look at the wood pile to find a wooden leg.
