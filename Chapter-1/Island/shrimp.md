So, you tried to get the 20th flower and ended up with a sore foot. What's up with that?

# I have found the source of the foot pain.
Ah, of course - the shrimp empire at the behest of Shrimpus Maximus.

Your new objective is to effectively assassinate the beaver that has been troubling the Shrimpire.

# Beaver? Where?
You may have seen him when exploring the island earlier.

# One more hint?
Beavers like to build dams - where would the best place to build one be on an island like this?

## Can you tell me where the beaver is?
North of the tent, a rocky path takes you up to a cliff; this cliff overlooks the pesky beaver.

Keep this location in mind, as it's the only place you can get access to the beaver.

# Alright, but what's the deal with the shrimp?
How am I supposed to know? I just write the hints, dude.

Anyway, he gave you a broken lance - what does it look like?

# A weapon?
Well, for shrimp, yes - but what can it do for a human?

## Knitting?
No, lock picking! This is a video game, after all! Go pick the locked drawer in the tent!

# Stealth Increased!
You got the socks and Malthe's cocktail bible.

If the name 'Malthe' is unfamiliar, try [exploring the island some more.](malthe.md)

# Uh, socks? In a drawer?
Yes, socks go in a drawer. Where else do you put clothes?

# A hint, please?
These socks are quite a distracting colour. 

Bonus hint: ^[Did you find anything that could be distracted?]

## A less cryptic hint, please?
Put the socks on the washing line near the tent to distract the naughty crab.

^[This gives you an opportunity to take the tights from the washing line.]

# Now what?
It always helps to know your enemy. Don't you have a good vantage point near here?

# I see the beaver!
Doesn't that forked tree look suspicious?

^[You must be at the top of the jagged rocky path to see the beaver and tree.]

## How can a tree look suspicious?
Like it has warfare potential! Put the tights between the branches, and you've basically made a slingshot.

Now, what could be launched with a slingshot?

# Hmm, I don't have anything projectile-y.
Have you [fully explored the island?](malthe.md)

If so, think about what the hardest item in your inventory would be.

## Tell me what to launch.
The jawbreaker that Malthe Seus spat out - it's a bit hard to see, but is on the deck of his ship.

Approach the makeshift slingshot with the tights and jawbreaker to set up the slingshot and fire it at the beaver.

#Target down!
You should share the good news with a friend who was eager to see the beaver fall.

# We are victorious!
And to the victor goes the twentieth flower that the Siren wanted!

Make sure to explore this new island thoroughly - ^[The flowers aren't the only thing on it.]

## And yet, I'm coming away mostly empty handed...
Aside from the twenty-six extra folo flowers, there's a pile of wood where the beaver once was.

Get a close look at the wood pile to find a wooden leg.
