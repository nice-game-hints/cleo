You've been helping out around the island - now it's time to go home.

# I helped with a moustache!
Fantastic, that means the swamp monster has left - and what did he leave behind?

# A broken heart?
Er, you barely knew the guy - but what else did he leave behind?

## I don't see anything
In the spot you were talking to him, his cocoon has been left behind. 

Doesn't it look like something you can use?

# Like what?
It's big, white, and could probably catch the wind well.

## Tell me what to do with the cocoon.
Take it to Malthe Seus, who will use it as a sail.
