You've made good progress with the puzzles on the island - but you never found any tomatoes.

What did you find, though?

# I found a beaver!
Yes, and made his children orphans. Do you remember what you found on the island he guarded?

# A wooden leg?
That was one of the things you found, yes. What was the other?

## Uhhh....
Flowers! Twenty-six flowers that humiliated you!

Go deliver them to the siren.

## I have delivered the flowers to the siren and receieved a gift.
So, you've met madame jichomilele - interesting lady.

Close to where you found the caged parrot, a plant is growing tomatoes. Take one.

# I have a tomato.
