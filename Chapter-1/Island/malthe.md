There's evidence that another person is somewhere on this island.

# What? All I've found are mythical creatures and talking animals!
Have you explored the southern part of the island?

# Yes.
Then you've met Malthe Seus, captain of the Attempt 38, and unfortunate owner of a broken cocktail machine.

Did you get an item from the boat?

# No?
He spat something out when you surprised him.

# I don't see anything...
Look closely at the ground.

## Pixels, pixels everywhere, and not a hint to... drink?
There's a jawbreaker candy on the ship, a few steps to the right of where Malthe's standing. He spat it out when you surprised him.

# Okay, gross, but what about the cocktail machine?
It's missing a lever. Have you found anything that could fix it?

# Like what?
Well, something sturdy could work well. What about wood?

# And where would I get a sturdy bit of wood?
Explore the eastern part of the island a bit more - and [check out these hints](shrimp.md) when you've got a good idea of where to find wood.

## I have sourced a sturdy bit of wood.
Great, that wooden leg will work perfectly! Legs are quite similar to levers, if you think about it.

# If you say so. Machine's fixed, now what?
Have a play around with it. It's a cocktail machine after all, you can mix and match ingredients as you please.

# This machine doesn't know many recipes.
Do you have any items that could teach you cocktail recipes?

## ...Would a severed hand teach me cocktail recipes?
No, but the cocktail bible you got along with the socks would!

Remember that some items are only usable by pressing TAB - but they must still be equipped in your inventory.

# Fascinating - but why would I make any of these?
Have you fully explored the island? [The swamp, perhaps?](moustache.md)
