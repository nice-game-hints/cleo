# I missed the part where that's my problem.
Ah, of course - the shrimp empire at the behest of Shrimpus Maximus.

Your new objective is to take out that beaver you may have seen when exploring the island earlier.

# Where do I even begin?
You've got a broken lance now - what does it look like?

# A weapon?

# TWENTY?
Yep. You saw a picture of one - find twenty of those.

## Can you just tell me where to find the first ten?

Number one - ^[East of the siren. You'll need to go around her pond.]
Number two - ^[North of the first flower, near the 'Telmi Swamp' sign]
Number three - ^[East of the same sign.]
Number four - ^[Right next to number three.]
Number five - ^[East of the previous two flowers, near two barrels.]
Number six - ^[South-east of the previous flower, next to a tree.]
Number seven - ^[Near the sixth flower, on the other side of the tree.]

Number nine - ^[North of the previous flower - directly in your path.]
Number ten - ^[Right next to the previous flower.]

Number eleven - ^[When you have the option of going west or north on the east side of the island, go west to find this flower.]
Number twelve - ^[North-west of the previous flower.]
Number thirteen - ^[Following the path north and out of the swamp reveals this flower.]
Number fourteen - ^[Even further north, on the peak of the island, is this flower.]
Number fifteen - ^[In a cluster southeast of the previous flower.]
Number sixteen - ^[Right next to the previous flower.]
Number seventeen - ^[Also right next to the previous flower.]
Number eighteen - ^[Directly east of the three-flower cluster.]
Number nineteen - ^[Backtracking slightly, this flower is directly north of the 'Telmi Swamp' sign.]

# And the twentieth?
You saw it when you picked up number eighteen. How might you reach that island?

## There's no path!
