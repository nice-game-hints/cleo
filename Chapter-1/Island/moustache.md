This is a big island, and the swamp makes up a good chunk of it - might be worth exploring.

# I found... something.
Ah, a friendly swamp monster. Interesting fella, shame that he can't grow a moustache.

# I missed the part where that's my problem.
Yeah, how hard could it be to grow a moustache naturally?

# Is that rhetorical?
Yes, obviously you'll need to help somehow.

# Where should I start?
Have you found all twenty flowers?

# Nope!
Have you found nineteen flowers?

# Nope!
Then [this guide](siren.md) would be a good place to start.

# Okay, I have nineteen flowers.
And if you want to know how to get the twentieth, follow [this guide.](shrimp.md)

# Okay, I have twenty flowers.
You should also have Malthe's Cocktail Bible! Maybe one of the entries might be useful?

# A-ha!
That's right, "Michael Hair Jordan!" And the cocktail machine has what you need.

# To the cocktail machine!
You need three ingredients to make the Michael Hair Jordan.

Ingredient 1 (Base) - ^[Whiskey, AKA "GlenModrig 18 Year - Whiskey"]
Ingredient 3 (Flavor) - ^[Coconut Milk]

## What about Ingredient 2, the modifier?
If you don't have a tomato yet, remember to finish your errands.

## What errands?
Deliver the flowers, silly! [This guide](jichomilele.md) tells you what to do next if you're struggling.

Return to this guide after finding a tomato.

## I'm back, and I have a tomato.
Great, you should already know what to do then!

Ingredient 1 (Base) - ^[Whiskey, AKA "GlenModrig 18 Year - Whiskey"]
Ingredient 2 (Modifier) - ^[Tomato]
Ingredient 3 (Flavor) - ^[Coconut Milk]

Then just pull the lever for your cocktail!

# Michael Hair Jordan? Uh?
The cocktail bible might be able to tell you what it does.

## Can you tell me where to put it, though?
Right where the sun doesn't shine - the swamp! 

Put the cocktail into the liquid that the swamp monster is drinking.

# What now?
The swamp monster left something behind.
