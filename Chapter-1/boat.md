You've gone from barmaid to shiphand - does the ship need a hand?

# Who owns this ship?
Butthair Pete, the man from the bar. He might be able to tell you what to do.

^[He's very close to your starting position, standing at the wheel.]

# What is there to see?
There's bound to be a crew on (or in) this ship. See what they have to say.

## This guy's just talking about knots?!
Go downstairs and talk to the other crew member.

# At least he's not talking about knots!
But he wants a new opponent to play Kraken Fodder with, and told you who might have cards you can borrow.

## I wasn't paying attention!
At least you're honest. Go talk to Knot Joe on the upper deck again.

# The art of conversation
It'll take all day to brute-force guess who made the knot he quizzed you about.

^[This puzzle is randomised.]

# Guesswork sucks!
Tell him you'll be back in a moment if you don't want to guess, and [look for clues.](quiz.md)
