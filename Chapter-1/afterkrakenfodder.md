What can you use to fix the hole?

# Where should I start looking?
It's easier to think with dry shoes!

## Dry shoes?
Get above deck and grab the tools!

# I've got the tools, now what?!
Get back down below deck and give them to Erik!

# I'm below deck!
Erik?! Where's Erik?!

## WHAT IS GOING ON?
Get back above deck to see if you can figure it out!
