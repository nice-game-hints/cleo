Who made that weird-sounding knot?

# Clues?
Where would you put something you like to look at?

^[Somewhere it's not going to be exposed to the elements.]

## My brain's in a knot!
The poster below-deck might deserve a closer look. ^[You can click to interact while inspecting an object closely like this.]

Now, is there anywhere you haven't explored in the boat's lower decks?

# Only...
The locked door? Yes, who would be responsible for the keys?

## I'm not sure!
The ship's captain, Butthair Pete.

# Unlocked the door!
The only thing in this room is a suspicious barrel. Do you remember what Knot Joe told you?

# Yes, but there's so many names!
Maybe you have something in your inventory that can help?

Don't forget that ^[You can press TAB to use some items.]

# Yes, but there's so many symbols!
Do you remember Knot Joe's description of the knot? If not, you can talk to him again to hear it.

# Some of these symbols and names are hard to see!
You can use the arrows on the left and right to spin the barrel and paper independently.

## I'm still confused, my barrel's spinning!
Knot Joe uses this paper and barrel to remember knot names - what little tricks is he using to remember better?

Part 1 of solution: ^[Line a symbol from the barrel up with a symbol from the paper. The symbols should match something from Joe's knot description.]
Part 2 of solution: ^[Look for a word that matches Knot Joe's description.]

Remember the name that the paper lines up with, and go impress Knot Joe!

# The name I settled on wasn't an option!
Then you either settled on the wrong name, or Knot Joe changed his description. Try, try again!
