Ew, shrimp heads should never be thrown at someone! Good thing it was just a cocktail umbrella... probably.

# Serving the clientele
Butthair Pete wants a bottle. ^[The bottle he wants is, unsurprisingly, behind the bar.]

# Order up!
Right-click while facing your dad to give Pete the bottle.

# Another round!
Dad wants you to bring a bottle of rum to Granny Gabble. ^[The bottle you must deliver is right next to the first one you picked up.]

## Where is Granny Gabble?
On the docks, accessed by going left of the bar. ^[Get out from behind the bar by left-clicking when facing the counter flap.]

# No rest for the wicked
There's not much to do out on the docks, so when you've given Granny Gabble the rum, go back inside the bar and talk to dad.

# Hungry?
Herbert wants six fish in total from the net. ^[Approach the net at the top of the room and left-click to take a fish.]

# Quite unsanitary!
Well, the original owner probably doesn't want it anymore - take the strange logbook and pry the fingers off it! ^[Click the fingers, and note that lifting some will press down others.]

## How do I loosen this hand's grip?
Click the fingers in this order: Ring Finger, Index Finger, Ring Finger, Little Finger, Index Finger, Ring Finger.
 Click the question mark for a picture labelling the fingers. ^[(HandPuzzle.png)]

# Woah!
A cutscene will rearrange the kitchen. Get a closer look at the changes. ^[Read the bloody writing on the wall.]
