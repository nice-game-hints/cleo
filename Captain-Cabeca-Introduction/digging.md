The game begins with an introduction to Captain Cabeca as you're taught the controls. 

You need to discover the treasure that he's come to this island to find.

# Great! I have a shovel!
You can use it to dig up the dirt in the area.

# How?
Right-click while standing atop a dirt patch to dig it up. 

Equipped items' borders in the bottom right corner of the screen will turn orange when you stand near something they can be used with.

# Digging in!
Third time clearly wasn't a charm - skeletons!

As the game instructs you to, click the middle mouse button to open your bag and left click on the cutlass to equip it.

# Armed to the teeth!
Approach the skeletons and swing your sword at them. ^[The skeletons will take three hits each to kill.]

Swing by right-clicking rapidly while it's equipped.

# They're all dead!
What's that on the ground? You can examine it by approaching and left-clicking.

## Okay, as you said, it's shiny. Now what?
Open your bag again using the middle mouse button and equip your shovel. Just like you did before, dig in the shiny spot by right clicking.

# What is this?
You've just got a new item in your inventory - why not open it and right click?

# Can I play Wonderwall?
Well, maybe, but shouldn't you look at everything in your inventory for clues?

^[Don't forget about the item bound to your 'tab' key.]

# What should I be looking for?
On your map, does anything stand out? 

Additional hint: ^[Does anything on the map match anything on the Kalimba?]

## Which notes do I play on the Kalimba?
C-E-A-B-E, in that order. ^[Only the first 'E' on the Kalimba - the second is not used.]

# What now?
Take the treasure you came here for!

^[It's Ignatz' will-o-the-wisp, glowing, you really can't miss it.]
