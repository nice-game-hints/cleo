Captain Cabeca's engaging in some classic pirate behaviour - [digging for buried treasure!](digging.md)

This part of the game acts as a tutorial, teaching you the controls that you'll be using.

You need to find the treasure that he's seeking on this island by using everything that Cabeca's brought with him - even if it seems useless at first glance.
