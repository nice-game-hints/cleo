The game begins with an introduction to Captain Cabeca as you're taught the controls. He's looking for buried treasure.

#I have a shovel
You can dig up the dirt in the area.

#How?
Right-click on the shovel while standing atop the dirt patches to dig them up. Equipped items' borders will turn orange when you stand near something they can interact with. ^[Dig three times to make progress.]

#Digging in!
Skeletons have appeared. Click the middle mouse button to open your bag, and left click on the cutlass to equip it.

#Armed to the teeth!
Approach the skeletons and swing your sword at them. ^[Swing by right-clicking rapidly while it's equipped. The skeletons will take three hits each to kill.]

#All that glitters is gold?
The skeletons are dead and a glimmering light has appeared. Is it something buried? ^[Examine it by approaching and left-clicking.]

#Digging in, again!
Using the shovel on the loosened earth has put the Kalimba in your bag. ^[Equip it and left-click.]

#Time for a sea shanty?
The kalimba can be used to play a tune. ^[The burn holes in your map aren't coincidental. Neither are the numbers on the left.]

##What notes do I play?
C-E-A-B-E, in that order. ^[Only the first 'E' on the Kalimba - the second is not used.]

#Treasure!
Take the treasure you came here for - Ignatz's will-o-the-wisp.
